bugs:
cards wont stack properly, or at least look wrong when hovering cards stacked more than 10
z axis is backwards? maybe?
fix camera width height on window

refactor/clean up code:
add a method to read in a vao from file

polish:
add a border around hovered cards
add lighting to shaders
allow cards in hand to be reordered
make dragging a card onto the deck put it on deck top
don't allow cards to be placed colliding with the deck and visaversa
