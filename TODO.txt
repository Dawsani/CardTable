allow a deck of stacked cards to be created from a file full of card names, each with a corresponding image file
create the hand in screen space
allow cards to be dragged to and from the hand and the board
add counters
add tokens
show close up of a card on hover
networks, client/server multiplayer

bugs:
cards wont stack properly, or at least look wrong when hovering cards stacked more than 10
z axis is backwards? maybe?
fix camera width height on window

refactor/clean up code:
add a method to read in a vao from file

polish:
add a border around hovered cards
add lighting to shaders
